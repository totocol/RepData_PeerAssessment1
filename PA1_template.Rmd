## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
require(ggplot2) 
require(plyr)
require(graphics)

fileRead <- read.csv('activity.csv', header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA") 
dayAggregate <- na.omit(aggregate(fileRead$steps, list(date = fileRead$date), sum))
colnames(dayAggregate) <- c("dates", "steps")
summary(dayAggregate)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
dayAggregate$dates <- as.Date(dayAggregate$dates, "%Y-%m-%d")

dayAggregate$steps <- as.numeric(dayAggregate$steps)

#head(dayAggregate)

#lapply(dayAggregate,colnames)

dates <- dayAggregate$dates
steps <- dayAggregate$steps
qplot(dates, steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
